# duma

A project by Developer Student Club UCC to learn  Flutter mobile development.

The Developer Student Club group of the
University of Cape Coast is currently undertaking flutter 
development section in 2019, second semester.

It is a project based software that will
lead to the developmentment of an app (duma) that 
implements API call to the hacker news api.

The app is built with Flutter and allows the user to 
slide to delete a story, click to share or read online
using url launcher plugin.

I am honored to be part of the Co-leads.

Screenshots of the app can be found in the 
"Screenshots folder".
happy coding..
